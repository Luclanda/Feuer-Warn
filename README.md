#Feuer-Warn
Feuer-Warn is a system that utilizes object detection to warn people through a localhost.

Feuer-Warn is built for Raspberry Pi. You need to run a command to start the camera. If desired, you can also execute the yolo.py code from another device, but in that case, you must specify the command for the terminal.
