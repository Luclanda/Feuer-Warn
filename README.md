# Feuer-Warn
Feuer-Warn is a system that utilizes object detection to warn people through a localhost. The object detection model is a Yolov8 m. 

Feuer-Warn is made for Raspberry Pi, but you can also use it in Jupyter Notebook. You need to run the command camerastartcomand to start the camera. If desired, you can also execute the yolo.py code from another device, but in that case, you must specify the command for the terminal.
